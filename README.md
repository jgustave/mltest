The goal of this project is to learn more about Machine Learning techniques.
There are many fine ML kits (Like WEKA), but this is not one of them.
This is simply to familiarize myself with the concepts and the implementations of various algorithms.

My First goal will be to implement Batch Linear Regression and Logistic Regression using gradient descent using Colt as
the my linear algebra library.
