The goal of this project is to learn more about Machine Learning techniques.
There are many fine ML kits (Like WEKA), but this is not one of them.
This is simply to familiarize myself with the concepts and the implementations of various algorithms.

My First goal will be to implement Batch Linear Regression and Logistic Regression using gradient descent using Colt as
the my linear algebra library.

3/14/13  Success in my initial Linear and Logistic implementaitons using Gradient Descent.
I'm going to now use Mallet to implement the same using gradient and cost functions and L-BFGS...
and finally finishing on Neural Nets.

3/22/12  Success this week getting LBFGS working. Mallet seems to be maximizing, so I had to flip the signs. LBFGS-B (some fortran code)
Seems to be performing the best. No strange errors, minimizes by default, and it converges to an answer much closer to
 a super fine gradient descent.. So Mucho Success! I think next week I will start focusing on getting a NN to work
 using LBFGS-B.  Finally starting to be able to read all those Summations, etc. Lets see how I do when it's a Tripple Sum! :)
